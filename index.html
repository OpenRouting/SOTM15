					<h2>OSM + Pedestrian Routing = <3</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Did you all know you can model pedestrian routing
						networks in open street map?

						It was added to the default Open Street Map interface earlier in the year.

					<h2>The Competition</h2>
					<img src="picture/google.jpg" alt="Google Logo" />
					<img src="picture/esri.jpg" alt="Esri Logo" />
					<img src="picture/here.jpg" alt="Here Logo" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Google, Esri, and Here all provide pedestrian routing to one degree or
						another. The public api's are not totally amazing. Most of their
						directions will route you down the side of a road. They are starting
						to get better about adding footpaths and such.

						In addition these services also don't take wheelchair accessibility into account. I spent
						most of college helping my father navigate suburban maryland in a motorized wheelchair. It is
						a real pain to park in front of a store only to find out that the curb cutout is five stores down.

				<section>
					<img src="picture/navigator.jpg" alt="GeoMetri Navigator" />
					<aside class="notes">
						At my 9-5 at GISi Indoors I build indoor pedestrian routing networks for college campuses,
						airports, and convention centers. I started really hacking around on Open Street Map
						after State of the Map last year. I created a Github repo to document how to setup
						pedestrian routing networks in OSM.

						Here are a few tips and tricks on editing data to support pedestrian routing
						AND wheelchair accessible routing.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway">Highway Tag</a> (aka feature types)</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Footway:</b> Designated pedestrian path or trail</li>
						<li><b>Path:</b> Generic path or trail for bikes and walking</li>
						<li><b>Steps:</b> Flight of Stairs</li>
						<li><b>Elevator:</b> Elevator</li>
						<li><b>Pedestrian:</b> Designated road or plaza for pedestrians</li>
						<li><b>*:</b> Any other road type with *Sidewalk* Tag</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						The MOST IMPORTANT part is picking what type of feature type to draw.

						Footways are your standard walking path or sidewalk.
						Paths are mixed use paths for bicycles, pedestrians, horses, or whatever.
						Steps and Elevators are... Steps and Elevators.
						Pedestrian ways are those streets in historic districts that are closed off to cars.
						You can also just assign a "sidewalk" tag to any other road feature, but you don't
							get the granularity of a standalone footway or path.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Drawing</h2>
					<img src="picture/vertex.png" alt="Paths at vertex" />
					<img src="picture/bridge.png" alt="Bridges" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Paths are only connected if they share a vertex.

						Paths that are not connected at a vertex are treated like a bridges and tunnels.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access">Access Tag</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Yes:</b> Accessible to Anyone</li>
						<li><b>No:</b> Not Accessible to Anyone</li>
						<li><b>Private:</b> Private Use Only</li>
						<li><b>Permissive:</b> Accessible to Anyone, at Owners Discretion (stores)</li>
						<li><b>Delivery:</b> Only for delivery people</li>
						<li><b>Discouraged:</b> Awkwardly Accessible to Anyone.)</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						The access tag defines who can take the route. Is it
						publicly accessible, not accessible, or awkwardly accessible like that
						neighborhood trail that is kinda in your neighbor's yard.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Wheelchair Accessibility Tags</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:ramp">ramp:</a> The path is a ramp. (Yes|No)</li>
						<li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:incline">incline:</a> Percent incline of path.</li>
						<li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:smoothness">smoothness:</a> The surface smoothness of the path. (impassable->excellent)</li>
						<li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:width">width:</a> The width of the path (meter).</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>wheelchair:</b> The path is wheelchair accessible. (Yes|No)</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						There is a reason that google doesn't have wheelchair
						accessible directions. The impacts of wrong data are really bad.

						The ADA requirements for accessible routes are incredibly strict. At a minimum, use
						the first four tags here to make the determination.

						1) Ramps are usually wheelchair accessible
						2) Except for when the incline is too crazy
						3) Intermediate and above smoothness are your best bet
						4) Finally the width should be at least meter

						If all of these attributes are set then you can go ahead and set wheelchair to Yes

						The OSM website is awesome because you'll be able to test your routes a few minutes after saving.

						I'm slowly working on an ETL process and API for pedestrian routing. Please
						hit me up at the break if you are interested in pedestrian routing and wanna chat.
